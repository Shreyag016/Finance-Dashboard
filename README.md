📊 ATM Transaction Dashboard

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive interactive dashboard for monitoring and analyzing ATM transaction metrics across different states and months. It helps stakeholders identify revenue trends, transaction performance, and maintenance costs across ATMs.

🚩 Problem Statement
ATMs are critical infrastructure for financial services, but they come with challenges:

High operational and maintenance costs (e.g., CRA, Spare parts, AMC).

Varying revenue performance across states and ATMs.
